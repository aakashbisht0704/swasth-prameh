This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the Next.js web server (port 3000) and the LLM server (port 8002) concurrently.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running Servers Separately

If you need to run the servers separately:

```bash
# Run only Next.js web server
npm run dev:web

# Run only LLM server
npm run dev:llm
```

## Production

For production, use:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This will start both servers in production mode.

## Important Note for Vercel Deployment

Vercel uses serverless functions and doesn't support long-running processes. The LLM server (Express) needs to be converted to Next.js API routes for Vercel deployment, or deployed separately. For traditional VPS/hosting platforms, the current setup works fine.

## Google OAuth Configuration

For Google OAuth to work in production (especially on Vercel), you need to configure:

1. **Google Cloud Console** - Set up OAuth credentials and authorized redirect URIs
2. **Supabase** - Configure Google provider with Client ID and Secret
3. **Vercel Environment Variables** - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your production URL

See **[GOOGLE_OAUTH_VERCEL_SETUP.md](./GOOGLE_OAUTH_VERCEL_SETUP.md)** for detailed step-by-step instructions.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
